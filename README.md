# Customer-Churn-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis &amp; Visualization

## Introduction
Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company, can have a significant impact on a company's bottom line. I worked with churn data for a fictional Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California. I cleaned, prepared and analysed the data to uncover various insights.

## Dataset
This dataset sourced from www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground. This dataset has 2 tables and around 7000+ records of data and 20+ columns, which includes fields such as customer demographics, location, services, and current status and much more..

## Skills Used
CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Creating temporary result sets for complex queries.
Temporary Tables: Storing intermediate results for further analysis.
Window Functions: Performing calculations over specific result sets.
Aggregate Functions: Computing summary statistics like sums, counts, etc.
Creating Views: Creating virtual tables for simplified querying.
Converting Data Types: Changing the data type of specific columns.
Power Bi: For effective visualization

## Data Cleaning using SQL and Excel
1. Identified and Handled Missing Values:  
  a. Used SQL queries to identify rows with missing values (NULL) in specific columns.  
  b. Decided how to handle missing data, which may include filling in missing values with defaults, interpolating values, or removing rows with missing data.  
3. Used SQL to find and remove duplicate rows.  
4. Standardized data formats.  
5. Identified and corrected data inconsistencies, such as inconsistent abbreviations, misspellings, or variations in data values.  
6. Trimmed Whitespace:  
  a. Used excel to remove leading and trailing whitespace from text data to avoid issues with string comparisons.  
7. Converted data types when necessary.  
8. Validated numeric values.  
9. Ensured that date and time values are valid and follow the correct format.  
10. Imputed missing values based on statistical methods or domain knowledge.
